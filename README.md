# Naive-Bayes-Spam-Filter-for-Citizen-Grievances-at-District-Scale(:  An Integrated NLP, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning Framework for SMS Spam Detection.)

## Overview
This repository contains all documentation and supporting material for the patent filing of a **hybrid SMS spam detection system**. The system integrates **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), sentiment analysis, and transformer-based models** to detect and classify SMS messages as **spam or legitimate (ham)** in real-time.

---

## Objectives
- Develop a **hybrid spam detection system** combining NLP, ML, DL, and transformer models to improve accuracy and robustness.
- Enable **real-time classification** with low computational cost, suitable for deployment on standard hardware.
- Integrate **sentiment-aware features** for better identification of manipulative or promotional spam messages.

---

## Problem Addressed
Traditional SMS spam detection methods are **inefficient, non-adaptive, and context-insensitive**, leading to poor detection of evolving spam patterns. This invention addresses these limitations by providing a **robust, hybrid, and real-time solution**.

---

## Key Features
- Modular architecture for easy updates and scalability
- Sentiment-enhanced NLP preprocessing
- Multi-paradigm hybrid classification:
  - Naive Bayes (ML)
  - BiLSTM (DL)
  - Lightweight Transformer (Contextual modeling)
- Real-time interactive deployment interface
- Confidence scoring and sentiment interpretation
- Efficient operation on standard hardware without GPUs

---

## Dataset Used
- **SMS Spam Collection Dataset (UCI ML Repository)**
- Total messages: 5,574 (Ham: 4,827; Spam: 747)
- Language: English
- Format: Tab-separated text file

---

## Comparative Advantages
| Model / Method | Accuracy (%) | Computational Cost |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| Keyword-based filtering | ~85 | Very Low |
| TF-IDF + Naive Bayes | ~97 | Low |
| BiLSTM-only | ~98 | High |
| Transformer-only | ~98.5 | Very High |
| **Proposed Hybrid Invention** | **≥99** | **Moderate / Low** |

- Demonstrates **higher accuracy and recall** compared to prior art
- Maintains **low computational cost** for real-time deployment
- Provides **robustness against evolving spam patterns**

---

## Potential Commercialization
The system is applicable for:
- Telecom service providers (Reliance Jio, Airtel, Vodafone Idea)
- Mobile security applications (Truecaller)
- Financial and banking messaging platforms (Paytm, PhonePe)
- Enterprise and government communication platforms
